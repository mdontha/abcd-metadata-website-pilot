#### Where are the items measuring youth substance use?

TSP-ABCD was initially conceptualized as a predictive tool for high-risk, early substance use. As such, the lab prioritized evaluating whether variables could be considered items when they did not contain youth substance use. We are currently working on evaluating these variables and will update the metadata on this website once we have finished. Here is a [spreadsheet](https://www.rd.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pdf-sample_0.pdf) containing all potential items flagged for youth substance use.

#### Where can I find more detail about the creation of the bespoke item metadata?

You can find more details about our procedure for creating [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wit57vQvdoEeb6oLyM0x9mYwy2F0ez0y_4foyNkmhvY/edit?tab=t.0).
